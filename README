This is the first version of my temperhum driver for the pcsensor temperhum device.
it will create a device node in the /sys tree which will have two files, t and rh.
These files will display the temperature and relative humidity. 
You can also convert readings to Farenheit by echo F > <path to device>/t
or use centegrade again echo C > <path to device>/t

The udev rule will map this driver file to /etc/th. If you know a more elegant 
way of doing this, let me know!


LIMITATIONS
Tested on 2.6 kernel only.
Device driver is not HID aware. USBHID will try to claim the driver. You must 
either disable HID, or figure out a quirk for it that prevents it loading.

TODO
Re-write as a HID driver. 
Any help offered in this will be gladly accepted!
